            <div class='Bios'>
                <p>SpeedElite is an app that uninstalls unecessary or suspicious apps that might be slowing down your computer. If you don't want it uninstalling apps that you need, it can just warn you of apps that could potentially be using too much of your memory.</p>
                <div id='SpeedElite bio'>
                    <p>When our computers started slowing down, we knew that there had to be a solution to this. <br>Day and night we thought about a potential solution. And then we had an ah-hah! moment and realized that if you compare the two speeds (the control speed and the current speed) then you would be able find a problem. Then I incorparated some <a href="bulldog_bio.html">Bulldog</a> code and designed some code that would locate files and apps that you did not use and ask you which ones you wanted to uninstall and which ones you wanted to keep.</p>
